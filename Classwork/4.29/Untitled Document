remove for binarytree
use search part of insert to get a pointer t to the node we want to remove and
t2 to its parent (insert searches untill null, we stop when t.getData()==
thing to delete)
leaf easiest
root plus middle hardest

2a t is a leaf
     point t2's left or right to null 

2b t only has one child 
     point t2 left or right to t's only nonnull child

2a and 2b can be combined
2c t has two children
     find largest on left subtree or smallest on right subtree
     l=t.getleft
     while l.getright()!=null
     	   l=l.getright

     copy data in l to t

     remove t.getleft(),l.getData
     since will onyl have one child or none
