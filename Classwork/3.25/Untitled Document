first in first out
FIFO
ex. line, Queue

q.endqueue(x); adds x to back of queue
q.dequeue();  removes and return item in front of queue
q.head(); return but no remove front of queue
q.front(); return but no remove front of queue
	  cant pop then push like stack
q.empty();
q.size();
keep track of front and end to keep endqueue and dequeue to be constant
