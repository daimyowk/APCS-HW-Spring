weighted graphs
different routes take different costs
each edge has cost

single source shortest path algorithm 
Dijkstra's algorithm

init: start node in solution set
	use heap to store weights for A to every node
	if no way then inifinity 

1.grab node with lowest cost (n) and add to solution set
2.for each node in heap
	cost  = min(old costs)
	look at every node see if can do better
	cost to get to new node in soultion node + cost to get from
	new node in solution set to this node
