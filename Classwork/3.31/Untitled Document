depth first search - try one direction all the way until cant
      	    	   then another diection
used 2d array 
recursion
previous locations saved/stored on call stack

another way - breath first search
like radiating out
1 step in all directions
2 step in all directions
n step in all directions

try use while
    B
    C
D E A F G H
    U
    J K L

letters represent x,y coors

----------------



place start node on frontier
mark it processed
while (!frontier.empty() )
current = remove first node from frontier
if (
mark current as visited
for each unprocessed neighbor N of current 
mark N as processed 
and add n to frontier
frontier is a queue FIFO


if frontier stack = depth first 

need node with x and y

put xy on frontier 
while frontier not empty do stuff
