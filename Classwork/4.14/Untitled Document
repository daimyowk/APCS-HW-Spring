blind search
breadth first try more and gets one of best path
depth try less but not best path

heuristic search
has frontier
pick where to place neighbors in frontier
based on which closest

best first search (heuristic search)
makes estimate of what best to do
frontier is a priority queue
things are removed based on their priority 
  insert in order based on priority
  remove from front
   or 
   inserat at end
   remove by seraching for most priority
priority is a simple to compute value that hope get ot exit quickly
ex euclidean distance root of x2+y2
   manhattan distance/ taxicab x+y

A* search (heuristic)
priority/cost = cost to get to here + estimate to goal
