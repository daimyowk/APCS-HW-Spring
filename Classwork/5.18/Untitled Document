students with id 
add student by ID
retrieve by ID
change student after looking up by Id
all constant
3k students in 10k spots
index = studentID
some numbers not used
use subtraction to save some space

wont work for osis numbers

to make work look at last 4 digits of osis
work if no multiple studenst with last 4 digits

hashing/hash tables
want to store data in table(array) by some unique ID

hash functino is a mapping that takes id and converts it into
a table index
ex. id is osis#
    h(x)=x%10000
    better: h(x)= multiply all the non zero digits in x % 10000 
    always end with %tables size
    
fast efficent constant time
but has problems
when multiple IDs hash to same table index, have collision or clash

hash table must be large enought that it is sparesly populated
only if perfect hash function, no need extra space
need good hash function that distributes IDs all over the array

(dictionaries in python = hash tables)

abe
97 98 101

h=1;
for (i=0 to length(s)))
	h=h*3+int(s.charAt(i))
return h%tablesize

3 is prime number
can sub 3 with a prime number

hashtable must be sparse if full then collision

closed hashing
everything is stored in table(array)

collisions:
1. rehashing - have secondary hash function
 		easy but just delaying problem
		harder to get stuff back now

2. linear probing - if spot full just use next aviable spot
			no problem if table large and sparse
			bad if table small and not sparse
			creates mess
2 902
3 703
4 403
5 605
6 302

3. leave extra room in tables by using a multiplier in hash function:
 h(x) = x%100 * 3 
then linear probe, better a bit
makes table big and sparse

insert expected o(1) if everything right
	worst case o(n)

retrival
	expected o(1)
	worst case o(n)

delete  ? more random
search o(n) n size of table

open hashing
each array slot refers to a linked list that contains all elements that
hash to that slot

insert front of the linkedlist in the array; makes its fast and constant
always constant o(1);

retrival expected o(1);
o(n) with respect to number of elements in the that certain spot; still fast
