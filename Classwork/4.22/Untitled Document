graphs
-collection of nodes and edges
(vertex)node - holds stuff
edge - connects nodes
connected components 
cycle graph
get at least one node back to self without repeating
Acyclic graph

weights- assoicated value to edge

Dykter's algrithm 
used for gps

directed graph
only able to go in certain directions 

DAG
directed acycle graph

restriction on graphs -  TREES
empty or acycle graph with one node designated as root
root-starting point
child-connected to and 1 level down from its parent node
leaf- node with zero children
path - sequence of nodes and or edges connecting two nodes
ancestors - parents' parents anynodes from you up to root
desencends - any node on subtree
siblings - children of the same parent
height - length of longest route 
fullness - tree with max number of nodes
balance 

Binary Tree
each node has 0,1,2 children
